	      <h2>2008, Bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendments Act</h2>
	      <p>In January 8, 2008, the Bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendments Act was signed into law. The rule offered to improve electronic recordkeeping for use in background checks which would bar gun ownership by some who have been deemed mentally impaired. On February 28, 2017, President Trump signed legislation overturning a rule to implement this law.</p>

	      <h2>2013, Host of Bills Fail</h2>
	      <p>The Senate took up a host of bills, including one that would have mandated background checks for private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales, exempting most sales between family and friends. Other bills would have banned military-grade weapons, targeted gun trafficking and people who buy guns for others. Republicans, led by Sen. Grassley, backed legislation that would make it easier to carry guns across state lines, but that would also address mental illness, target straw purchasing and illegal firearm trafficking and increase resources to prosecute gun crimes. On April 18, 2013, the Senate rejected each of the bills.</p>

	      <h2>2015, Bill to Eliminate the "Charleston loophole" Fails</h2>
	      <p>Democrats proposed closing what became known as the “Charleston loophole,” which allows federally licensed firearms dealers to proceed with a sale if the FBI doesn’t complete a background check in three days. Because of this “default proceed” rule, the gunman was allowed to purchase his firearm legally. The bill would have eliminated the three-day deadline, however, it never came up for a vote in either the House or Senate.</p>

	      <h2>2015, Senate rejects proposal to set up measures to prevent firearm purchases</h2>
	      <p>The Senate revisited the host of bills rejected in 2013, along with different “no-fly, no buy” measures that would prevent or delay individuals on the terror watch list from purchasing firearms. Still, the Senate rejected the measures a day after the shooting.</p>

	      <h2>2017, Bump Stock Legislation Proposed</h2>
	      <p>Lawmakers in both parties proposed banning “bump stocks” that accelerate a semi-automatic rifle’s rate of fire. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said regulations are the “smartest, quickest fix" to address rapid-fire devices like the one used in the Las Vegas mass murder; the legislation is still pending.</p>

	      <h2>2017, GOP talks Bill to fix background checks</h2>
	      <p>After shootings, Republicans have been quick to say that gun control legislation isn’t the answer. But the clerical error that allowed this gunman to buy a gun even when he wasn’t supposed to, has given GOP lawmakers a small window to act on gun control. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas announced Tuesday afternoon that he was introducing a bill to try and incentivize federal agencies to put in the system.</p>

	      <h2>2018, Student Activism, the "Red Flag" Bill and Ban on Bump Stocks</h2>
	      <p>Students took the lead pushing for action after the tragedy. But they made little headway in Congress, with Republicans in control of the Senate. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, introduced a “red flag” bill, seeking to give law enforcement the ability to restrict gun access for unstable and potentially violent people. The Trump administration issued a new rule banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to rapid fire.</p>

	      <h2>2019, Failure to Expand Background Checks</h2>
	      <p>Immediately after the shootings, Mr. Trump opened the door to expanded background checks and other proposals to keep guns away from unstable people. However, Mr. Trump backed away from his position, saying that sufficient background checks were in place and the focus should instead be on mental health.</p>

	      <h2>2022, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and Ban of Military-Style Magazines</h2>
	      <p>The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was the result of negotiations by a handful of Republican and Democratic senators. The law provides more funding for mental health services and school security, expands criminal background checks for some gun buyers, bars a larger group of domestic-violence offenders from purchasing firearms, and funds Red Flag programs that allow police to seize guns from troubled individuals.</p>
