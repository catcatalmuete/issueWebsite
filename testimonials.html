	    	Carmen was the kind of daughter a mom can’t help but be proud of. 
	    	She was brilliant, caring, beautiful, funny, and musically talented. She dreamt of going to prom,
	    	going to college, becoming a medical researcher, and having a family of her own.
			But Carmen never got to realize her dreams. She was shot four times as she tried to hide in her
			AP Psychology class at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She was just 16 years old.
			That was five years ago today. Five years ago, on Valentine’s Day 2018, a former student,
			armed with an assault weapon and more than 300 rounds of ammunition, killed Carmen and 16 others and wounded 17 more people. <br><br>

			That day changed my life forever. And I know I’m not alone in that. In the aftermath of Carmen’s shooting,
			her classmates, along with our family and the families of other victims, stood up to demand change, sparking a movement that changed the country forever. That inspired countless people, maybe even some of you, to get off the sidelines and into this fight to end gun violence.<br><br>

			I joined the gun violence prevention movement and the board of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility to do 
			my part to make sure that no one else has to experience the heartbreak that I live with every single day.
			I am so proud of the progress that we have made. In Washington, we have restricted high-capacity magazines likethe ones Carmen’s shooter used, kept guns away from people intent on causing harm, and closed deadly loopholes.<br><br>

			But our work is far from over. We must build on the progress we’ve made to save lives by prohibiting
			assault rifles once and for all and enacting other evidence-based safeguards to prevent gun violence
			in all its forms.<br><br>

			I know that no single gun safety policy will bring Carmen back–no single policy alone will end the
			gun violence epidemic. But I also know that there is more that we can and must do. I hope you’ll
			join me today in recommitting to this fight for our lives.<br><br>

			Thank you,<br>

	    	I will never forget that 4:00 AM phone call in September 2008—on what was the first day of school—telling me my son had been shot. I will never forget arriving at the hospital, the same hospital where my beautiful boy was born 20 years before, and finding out that a bullet killed my son.<br><br>

			The image of him lying on a cold metal slab, murdered, blackened eye, stripped of all clothes, and personality is forever embedded in my brain. My tall, athletic, smiling son, full of laughter and love, now gone forever. I will never forget telling Joshua’s brother that he would never see his brother again.<br><br>

			Joshua’s smile is amazing. It felt like the sun shining through the car window on a warm summer day. He had the cheesiest grin, told jokes, gave great hugs, and loved his family and friends. He always said hello, gave you a ride, cheered on his teammates even when he was finished racing, and could even be a prankster on occasion.<br><br>

			He loved trying new activities and loved sports. By 3rd grade he broke the mile record in his school and continued to run track from then on. He was MVP in his middle school and high school for track and made it to state in cross country. He was active in student government from middle school through high school.<br><br>

			Josh was attending St Martin’s University in Lacey, Washington on an academic and athletic scholarship. A gifted runner, Joshua’s name can still be found on the track record board nearly 11 years after his death.<br><br>

			One evening in September 2008, Josh was staying over at a friend’s apartment when he answered a knock at the door. During an attempted robbery, gunmen shot Joshua while forcing entry into his friend’s apartment. His friend was also shot but survived after surgery. Joshua was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital several hours after the horrific shooting.<br><br>

			When Joshua was 12 our family did a time capsule for New Year’s Eve. We wrote to our future wife, children, and grandchildren. We wrote what we wanted to do in the future. Joshua wrote that he wanted to be a star athlete, a millionaire, live by the sea, and help people when they needed it most.<br><br>

			We didn’t open this time capsule until after Joshua was gone. We just forgot about it while trying to manage the “new normal” after your child is murdered.<br><br>

			Joshua did become a star athlete—his name is still on the track record board at his university. He is rich by all the friends and family he knows—over 600 people showed up to his funeral and that speaks to his character and demeanor. He wanted to live by the sea and part of him does. Every time his story is shared, he is helping people when they need it most.<br><br>

			Even though it’s been nearly 11 years my heart still aches for my son. People have no idea what families endure in the aftermath of a gun death—the court process, trials, and sentencing. I wonder about the life he would have, the career, the family. I wonder about the kind of father he would be. Holidays, weddings, graduations, and everyday activities no longer hold the same meaning. Things I would do or say with my son are gone forever to bullets.<br><br>

			I will no longer stand by when there is more that we can do to help families, schools, and communities be safer from gun violence. This is why I speak out about gun sense legislation. We all deserve to live in a world free from gun violence.<br><br>

	    	I was at church one January day in 2010 when I got a weird feeling. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was.<br><br>

			After church, I asked a friend to drive me to see my daughter Dana. When we got to her apartment, the door was locked and music was on really loud. That was when I knew something wasn’t right. I called the police right away. The moment the police opened the door, I knew Dana was gone. <br><br>

			She died by gun suicide on January 10, 2010. She was just 26 years old.  <br><br>

			Dana was a special child. At nine years old, she taught herself to speak Arabic. I couldn’t believe it. She was always gifted, but she struggled with depression. <br><br>

			For a time when she was a young adult, Dana was doing well. She started writing and she got her own apartment in Seattle. But eventually, the depression returned. <br><br>

			She started talking about suicide and I was afraid she had a gun. I was so worried she would hurt herself that I called the police and asked them to take her gun. They said there was nothing they could do. <br><br>

			In Washington state back then, law enforcement and family members like me had no tools to help keep guns away from people in crisis.  <br><br>

			That’s why I got involved in the campaign to pass Initiative 1491 and establish Extreme Risk Protection Orders. Because if Extreme Risk Protection Orders had been in place then, I might have been able to prevent my daughter from having the gun that killed her. <br><br>

			Since helping pass Extreme Risk Protection Orders in 2014, I have continued to fight for gun responsibility measures here in Washington because no one should have to live through the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence.<br><br>

			— Zoe Moore is Dana’s mother and a gun violence prevention advocate.
